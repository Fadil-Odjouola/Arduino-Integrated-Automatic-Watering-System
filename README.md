# Arduino-Integrated-Automatic-Watering-System
This project contains moisture sensors, water pumps, buttons, Arduino Nano Board, and OLED screen. This project is built to water multiple homogenous trays of certain plants (Ex. Kale, Tomato, and Cabbage)
# Requirements
* Must be able to water plants when they are dry
* Must not drown the plant during watering state
* Must be able to run for 3 weeks minimum
* Should water plant less when it's night time
* Must water a tray of same type of plants
* Must water a plant from seed to sampling life stage
* Should either have an immediate effect on a plant's dryness or prevent plant from drying
* Must be powered off an AC adpater
* Addition and removal of plant trays shouldn't impede watering system
* Entirety of the project should be under <$60
# SMART Outline
## Specific
**Who** - Me and possibly other students will work on this for other students & staff at BHS and residents in Greenbelt. With the school staff's apporval for BHS.  
  
**What** - A <$60 budget project with guide for developing configuration, circuits, code, and housing for the project.  
  
**When** - MVP must be completed by December, 31, 2025. Guide must be completed January 10, 2026.
  
**Where** - In the greenhouse room at Bladensburg High School, community garden in Greenbelt, and individual residences.  
  
**Why** - To provide both Bladensburg high schools students & staff and Greenbelt residents accesibility to gardening and building electronics. As well as to provide myself along with other  students with project building and management skills to tackle even bigger projects in the future.  
## Measurable
Parralell Jobs: Bill of materials -> Literary Guide w/Photos
Milestones: Methology research -> kit research -> circuit design | programming -> Fusion360 3DP CAD Design -> Test and Reiterations -> Final Report

### Conditions
**Methology <br> (Friday, November 21, 2025)**  
is completed with a paragraph long synthesis of 3 major sources on the consensus of hobby automated gardening  
  
**Kit Research <br> (Friday, November 21, 2025)**  
is completed with a list of possible kits that cover most electronics required for the project with links to buy additional parts  
  
**Parts List <br> (Friday, November 21, 2025)**  
is completed with a BOM table containing the characteristics of each part  
  
**Circui Design <br> (Tuesday, November 25, 2025)**  
is completed with a Drawing of a circuit schematic or a picture of the Sensors,MicroController, and PowerSupply put together on a bread/protoboard  
  
**Programming and Testing <br> (Friday, December 5, 2025)**  
is completed in this repository with video of system performance in different states  
  
**Fusion 360 3DP Mount Design <br> (Wednesday, December 10, 2025)**  
is completed with 3 drawing of radically different designs, a full assembly screenshot, and video of system performance in different states  
  
**Test and Reiteration <br> (Wednesday, December 17, 2025)**  
Completed with a video of system for each interative test and notes on each test and interation  
  
**Final Report <br> (Sunday, December 21, 2025)**  
Completed with 20 minute video going over each milestone in the project and talk about the final deisgn and performance of the system  
  
**Propose a Guide <br> (Wednesday, December 24, 2025)**  
Completed in this repo with README File and Google docs containing parts lists & links, and picture demonstration of buying & assembling parts

## Achievable
As a freshman college students I do not have alot of time to work on side projects, which is why I gave time commitments on this project a margin so I don't set a deadline I can't fit in my schedule. I may complete project milestones before the given deadline
I have access to online social platforms, databases, and documentation for research
Many different parts of the project

## Relative
As stated earlier:
The purose of this project is to provide both Bladensburg high schools students & staff and Greenbelt residents accesibility to gardening and building electronics;
To provide myself, along with other students, project building and management skills to tackle even bigger projects such as EPROM programming, organic chemistry research, or arm prostetic in the future. 

## Timely
Project must be completed by **December 31, 2025**. Failure to do so must be with a direct address video.
